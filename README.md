# SE-Assignment-4
Assignment: GitHub and Visual Studio
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of GitHub and Visual Studio. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Introduction to GitHub:

What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development.
GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code.
It makes use of the Git software, which offers access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for each project in addition to the distributed version control of Git.
features
GitHub issues -You may monitor your work on GitHub via GitHub problems. The issue's chronology keeps track of the relevant work when you cite an issue in another issue or pull-request. Issues and pull requests can be linked.
Gist code -Sharing brief snippets of code with others is easy with gist code. It's employed when you need to demonstrate a technique or piece of code to friends or coworkers. 
You can use GitHub to manage projects if it offers a card-based tool similar to Trello. To get started, click your repository's projects tab and choose "create a project." GitHub provides templates for organising tasks in the project workflow, and you can link pull requests to GitHub pull requests, set automatic triggers, and more.
One of GitHub's features for hosting the repository's documentation is GitHub Wiki. You have two options for editing wikis: locally or immediately on GitHub. You may learn more about Github Wikis from the GitHub Docs.
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting platform that uses files directly from a GitHub repository—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—to publish a website. You can check out the Introduction to Jekyll workshop or the GitHub Docs to find out more about this feature.


Repositories on GitHub:

What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it.
Version Control with Git:

Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
Branching and Merging in GitHub:

What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
Pull Requests and Code Reviews:

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
GitHub Actions:

Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
Introduction to Visual Studio:

What is Visual Studio, and what are its key features? How does it differ from Visual Studio Code?
Integrating GitHub with Visual Studio:

Describe the steps to integrate a GitHub repository with Visual Studio. How does this integration enhance the development workflow?
Debugging in Visual Studio:

Explain the debugging tools available in Visual Studio. How can developers use these tools to identify and fix issues in their code?
